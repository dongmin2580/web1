<p>Hello. My name is <strong>Dong <u>min</u>.</strong> When is your birthday?<br><br> <img src="coding.jpg" width="100%"><br><br> English is a West Germanic language that was first spoken in early medieval England and eventually became a global lingua franca.</p> <p>[4][5] It is named after the Angles, one of the Germanic tribes that migrated to the area of Great Britain that later took their name, England. Both names derive from Anglia, a peninsula in the Baltic Sea.</p>
